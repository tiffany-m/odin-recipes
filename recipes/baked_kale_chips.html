            These crispy oven-baked kale chips are a great homemade snack. You cannot stop at just eating one, just like potato

            Imagine being able to munch as many crunchy snacks as you want while you're binging that show you love without feeling
            guilty later. That's the beauty of these homemade baked kale chips. Made by quickly tossing together three simple
            ingredients – fresh kale, olive oil, and flaked sea salt – and baked low and slow for only 20 minutes, these crispy kale
            chips are easy to make, there are no mystery additives, and even fussy eaters snap them up.
